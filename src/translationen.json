    "All construction projects by Archi are carried out using the energy-efficient building block from the German brand Ytong. Ytong is a world leader in the production of building blocks and was named Germany's brand of the century in 2013.",
    "Compared to conventional concrete building blocks, Ytong blocks are 6 times less thermally conductive, meaning walls built with these blocks retain room temperature for longer. Heating or cooling the building consumes 40% less energy, reducing utility costs.",
    "Ytong blocks are made from eco-friendly, natural materials. Another advantage is their fire resistance. Under intense fire exposure, the block withstands fire for up to 4 hours. Ytong blocks are lightweight, reducing pressure on the structure, which contributes to safety during seismic activity.",
    "Archi uses concrete from the German brand HeidelbergCement. The company was established 150 years ago and has been operating in the Georgian market since 2006.",
    "Heidelberg Cement's concrete guarantees the durability of the building - the company is a world leader in cement and concrete production. Concrete is produced under laboratory supervision, and product quality is continuously tested to meet international standards.",
    "For facade finishing, Archi uses high-quality HPL panels from the world leader, the Austrian brand Fundermax. The company was founded in 1890 and has always used natural raw materials in production, a tradition it continues today. Fundermax panels are made using modern technology, are weather-resistant, and can withstand any weather and temperature.",
    "Archi also uses materials from the German brand Caparol for facade finishing. The company was established in 1895 and has earned a reputation as an innovator, which it still maintains today. Caparol's paints, plasters, and other components are known for their high quality, durability, and resistance to climate change.",
    "In Archi projects, the highest quality elevators are installed, one of which is the Finnish brand KONE, established in 1910, which gained worldwide recognition for its innovative elevators. KONE elevators are trusted globally because they are safe and feature a robust structure, excellent brakes, and an optimized drive system.",
    "For facade finishing, Archi uses materials from the Swiss brand Alucobond. Founded in 1969, Alucobond quickly established itself as a reliable company in the local market and later became a global brand. Today, its high-quality panels are used by leading brands around the world.",
    "For facade finishing, Archi uses bricks from the Austrian brand Wienerberger. The first Wienerberger brick factory opened in 1819 and became the largest factory in Europe over the years. Today, Wienerberger is a world leader in brick production. It produces durable and visually outstanding bricks that do not lose color or shape."

    "Recently, 'Archi' announced the construction of a multifunctional residential building near Miami, Florida, USA, on Pompano Beach. The project, called 'Archi Miami,' will include around 100 apartments, a pool, work, leisure spaces, and sports centers. The investment for the project is $50 million, and 'Archi' will implement it in partnership with the American development company 'Elite Group'.",
    "'After years of tireless work and high-quality projects in Georgia, I believe 'Archi' is ready to expand beyond the country's borders and establish itself in foreign markets. Of course, we will continue operations in Georgia â€“ we have several projects planned in different regions. However, at the same time, 'Archi' is focusing its efforts on penetrating the international market,' said Archi's founder, Ilia Tsulaia.",
    "Florida, where 'Archi's' new large-scale project will take place, is one of the most attractive locations for tourists, offering vast employment opportunities and flexible business regulations.",
    "'The popularity of this state is also evidenced by the fact that rental prices have risen by 14% over the past 24 months. The growing migration rate gives us reason to believe that demand for residential apartments will increase over the next 15-20 years. Thatâ€™s why the local municipality is supporting the urban development of Pompano Beach. I think in a few years, this area will become a unique and attractive place for both tourists and new residents,' said Giga Akirtava, partner at Elite Group.",
    "'Archi Miami' will also stand out with its architecture, and the quality of the project will fully meet the standards in the U.S. The visual aspect of the complex was developed by the leading American architectural company Deforma Studio.",
    "'In my 20 years of experience, this is one of the most exciting projects. It will be a very modern, industrial-style residential building, built with high-quality materials. I believe that due to its unique and refined appearance, it will easily stand out from other buildings in the area,' said project architect Javier Re Barrera."
